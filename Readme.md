The game *Battle Star* contains a space warship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move this object using the arrow keys on the keyboard, shoot objects using the spacebar, quit using the q key and play using the p key . 
When the game starts, we see a fleet of alien ships that fills the space above the player warship and move across the screen in random patterns. The player shoots and destroy the alien ships, when a fleet is destroyed a new fleet appears moving faster than the last and if any alien ship hits the player or crosses the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship and respawns if all ships are *lost* the game ends.
